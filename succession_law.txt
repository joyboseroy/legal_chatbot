Indian Succession Law (Hindus)

The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 governs inheritance and succession among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. If a Hindu male dies intestate (without a will), his property devolves first to Class I heirs â€” sons, daughters, widow, and mother.

If no Class I heir is present, Class II heirs are considered, such as father, siblings, and their descendants. The law also introduced equal inheritance rights for daughters through the 2005 amendment, granting them the same rights as sons in ancestral property.

Testamentary succession, i.e., via a will, is governed under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, for all communities except Muslims.
