Consumer Protection Act, 2019

This law protects Indian consumers from unfair trade practices, defective goods, and deficient services. It established the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) and introduced e-commerce liability.

Consumers can file complaints in District, State, or National Commissions depending on the claim amount. Key rights include:
- Right to safety
- Right to be informed
- Right to choose
- Right to be heard

Consumers may file complaints online through the E-Daakhil portal without needing a lawyer.
