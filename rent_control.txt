Rent Control Laws in India

Rent control in India is governed by state-specific acts like the Delhi Rent Control Act, Maharashtra Rent Control Act, etc. These laws regulate the relationship between landlords and tenants, covering rent amount, eviction procedures, repairs, and deposit terms.

Landlords can evict tenants only under specific grounds such as non-payment of rent, personal use, or building reconstruction. Most laws require due process via rent courts. The Model Tenancy Act, 2021 was introduced to modernize tenancy laws, but adoption by states is optional.

Tenants should always insist on written rental agreements to protect their rights.
