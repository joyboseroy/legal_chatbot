Senior Citizens Protection Act, 2007

The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 enables elderly persons (above 60) to demand maintenance from children or relatives responsible for their care.

They can file petitions before the Maintenance Tribunal (usually the SDM), and the tribunal can order monthly maintenance up to Rs. 10,000 and even revoke property transfers if made under coercion or unmet care promises.

Neglecting senior citizens is punishable under this law. Legal aid and fast-track hearings are often available to elderly complainants.
