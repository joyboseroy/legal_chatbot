Hindu Marriage Act, 1955

The Hindu Marriage Act governs marriage among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. It mandates conditions like monogamy, soundness of mind, and valid age (21 for males, 18 for females). Marriages are registered for legal proof, although registration is not mandatory for validity.

Grounds for divorce under the Act include cruelty, desertion, adultery, conversion, mental disorder, and mutual consent. Women can claim alimony and custody of children under this Act and related family laws.
